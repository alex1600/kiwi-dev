# PURPOSE
Shake your camera using Cinemachine Package !

# HOW TO USE:
- Create a gameobject in your scene and add the script as a component on it
- Set the variable in the inspector (from your cinemachine virtual camera)
- IMPORTANT: in your virtual camera, set Noise to "Basic Multi Channel Perlin" then create or choose a noise profile in function of what you need. 
- My personnal noise profile for 2D (It doesn't rotate your camera, it moves only on X/Y axis):
